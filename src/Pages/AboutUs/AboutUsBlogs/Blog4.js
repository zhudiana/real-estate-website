          Builder’s warranties vary greatly, so Apartment owners must take the
          time to learn what is covered. Even with new Apartments, things can go
          wrong. As a result, many buyers of newly constructed Apartments are
          interested in warranty, which offer to fix or replace certain
          components of the Apartments. The key to any of these warranties is
          understanding <b>what is and isn’t covered</b>, how to file claims,
          and the process for resolving disagreements that may occur between the
          customer and the builder or warranty provider.
        </p>
        <p className="blog1-each-blog">
          Most warranties for newly constructed Apartments offer limited
          coverage on work and materials as they relate to components of the
          Apartment, such as windows, siding, doors, roofs or plumbing,
          electrical, and HVAC systems. Warranties typically provide coverage
          for <b>one to two years</b>, although the specific period may{" "}
          <b>vary from component to component</b>; coverage may last up to a
          decade on major <b>structural elements</b>. Warranties also routinely
          define how repairs will be made and by whom.
        </p>
        <p className="blog1-each-blog">
          Warranties generally <b>do not cover</b> household appliances, tile or
          drywall cracks, irrigation systems, or components covered under a
          builder’s warranty. Most guarantees also exclude expenses incurred as
          a result of a warranty repair construction, such as the need to store
          household belongings while a repair is being made.{" "}
