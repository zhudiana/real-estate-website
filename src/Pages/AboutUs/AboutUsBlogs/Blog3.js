          Numerous things have changed in the last few years, including the real
          estate market. One consequence is a greater desire to purchase a
          second apartment. According to the recent Luxury Market Report from
          Luxury Home Marketing:{" "}
          <b>
            “As trends such as remote working took hold in 2021, so too did the
            flexibility of relocating as well as the growth of second
            homeownership.”
          </b>{" "}
          This might be because the pandemic has affected our perceptions of our
          apartments. Where we live has become, more than ever, our safe space
          and our getaway. With the rise of remote work, more individuals are
          rethinking where they want to live and purchasing second apartments to
          provide them more freedom. If you fall into such group, here are a few
          suggestions.
        </p>
        <h2 className="blog1-blog-title">Enjoy a Change in Scenery</h2>
        <p className="blog1-each-blog">
          When you have another Apartment, you may switch between homes whenever
          you want a change of scenery. You have numerous alternatives with two
          homes. Being able to move between homes based on the location that
          suits you best at that point gives you more flexibility, diversity,
          and happiness.
        </p>
        <h2 className="blog1-blog-title">Build Your Wealth Faster</h2>
        <p className="blog1-each-blog">
          You may have heard that home equity is skyrocketing in Addis Ababa,
          thanks to ongoing home price appreciation. With home prices expected
          to continue to rise, if you buy a second Apartment, you could take
          advantage of the increasing equity in both properties to build your
          wealth (and net worth) even faster.{" "}

        <p className="blog1-each-blog">
          If you want to stabilize your housing costs over the long term, we
          recommend buying a second apartment today. If you’re approaching
          retirement or are looking to use your second home as your permanent
          residence in the future, buying that Apartment now with today’s rate
          and price may be a good financial decision. So no matter what happens
          to rates and prices in the coming years, your cost of owning an
          apartment will be fixed for the next 15-30 years.{" "}
